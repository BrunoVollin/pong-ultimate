# Pong Ultimate

## Introduction

First, I would like to thank the academy and my mother for the banana cake recipe.
Second, I forgot to mention that this is my first practical project in the **Operating Systems** subject.

## Running

Run `pong-ultimate.exe` and this should work.

However, if you prefer a more traditional way of running a Python project...

1. Download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/);
2. In the console, write `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and press ENTER;
3. Then, still in the console, write `python main.py` and press ENTER again;
4. Have fun!
