Welcome to Pong Ultimate 1.1!

This game was created by me as the first practical project in the Operating Systems class, so don't expect too much from it.

However, it's still a fun game to play and I hope you enjoy it! =)

Special thanks to:
- Logan Kruger for his font (see 'assets/fonts/dotty/logan_kruger read me.html');
- Noise Collector (https://freesound.org/people/NoiseCollector/) for his sound effects;
- My loved bunny Feels for his music and coin sound effect. :3
